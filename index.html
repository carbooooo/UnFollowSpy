                            For users who may not have programming knowledge, this application assists in analyzing your Instagram following and followers. 
                            It extracts data from your Instagram profile, including the accounts you follow and those who follow you. 
                            It then compares these two lists to determine which accounts you follow but who do not follow you back.
                            This information can be valuable for users interested in managing their Instagram connections more effectively, such as unfollowing inactive or non-reciprocal accounts.

                            To use the app, follow these steps:

                            1. Download the app and place it in the same folder as your Instagram data files.
                            2. Ensure you have the necessary HTML files (e.g., "following.html" and "followers_1.html") in the same folder.
                            3. Run the app by executing it.
                            The program will process the data and provide you with a list of Instagram accounts that do not follow you back.
                            Please note that this program requires a basic understanding of how to organize files and navigate directories on your device. 
                            Additionally, always use such tools responsibly and respect Instagram's terms of service and guidelines.
